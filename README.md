Simple Calculator Console Application (C#)
==================================

My first attempt at using GitHub. :3 

For this purpose, I have prepared the simplest form of all C# programs, which is the Console Application.

In contrast of the normal first application that most programmers write, which is the 'Hello World' program, I have decided to go for a different path, which is to write a decent program which is also basic in essence.

The Simple Calculator program is a Console Application, specifically a basic calculator written using C# targetting the .NET Framework 3.5.

This application is not meant to replace your normal calculator. Rather, it is made as a demonstration to show how C# works and I apologise for the imperfections of the codes, if there is any.

Cheers!
